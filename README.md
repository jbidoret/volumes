## Credits

When external libraries were used, their licenses were provided (see libs).

The Python scripts were written by Julien Bidoret for the Maison des éditions.

The data contained in the csv files come from the websites of the exhibition's partner publishers and the work of the members of the Maison des éditions (Damien, Julien, Ivan, Christophe, Claire, Emma, Benjamin, Jean-Marc, Amish) and the interns who accompanied us during the exhibition at the Bel Ordinaire (Thibault, Alice, Gaelle, Laureane, Morgane).

The code contained in this repository is highly exhibition-specific but can be studied at will, copied and redistributed according to the terms of the associated license.
